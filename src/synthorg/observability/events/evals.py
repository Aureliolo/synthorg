"""Golden-benchmark eval-spine event constants for structured logging.

Constants follow the ``evals.<subject>.<action>`` naming convention
and are passed as the first positional argument to structured log
calls. The ``evals`` prefix is distinct from ``eval.*`` (used by the
legacy ``eval_loop`` subsystem in this package) and matches the
top-level ``evals/`` package that owns the golden-benchmark suite.
